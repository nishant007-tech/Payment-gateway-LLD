# Payment Gateway Architecture: Old vs New

## Architecture Comparison

### ❌ Old Approach: Factory Method

```
Client
  |
  | ProcessPayment()
  v
PaymentProcessor
  |
  | CreatePaymentMethod()
  v
PaymentFactory
  |
  | SWITCH BLOCK:
  | switch type {
  |   case "UPI":   return UPI
  |   case "CARD":  return Card
  |   // 50+ cases...
  | }
  |
  | Problems:
  | - O(n) lookup
  | - 50+ cases
  | - Must modify for new type
  v
Creates UPI Payment, Card Payment, etc.
```

**Issues with Factory Method:**
- Switch statements grow infinitely
- O(n) performance with many cases
- Must modify factory for every new method
- Violates Open-Closed Principle

### ✅ New Approach: Registry Pattern

```
Client
  |
  | ProcessPayment()
  v
PaymentProcessor
  |
  | Contains registries
  v
MethodRegistry          GatewayRegistry
  |                       |
  | MAP LOOKUP:           | MAP LOOKUP:
  | Map{                  | Map{
  |  "UPI": CreateUPI     |  "RZP": CreateRazorpay
  |  "CARD": CreateCard   |  "PP": CreatePayPal
  | }                     | }
  |                       |
  | Benefits:             | Benefits:
  | - O(1) lookup         | - O(1) lookup
  | - No switches         | - No switches
  | - Add at runtime      | - Add at runtime
  v                       v
CreateUPIPayment()      CreateRazorpayGateway()
  |                       |
  v                       v
UPI Payment            Razorpay Gateway
```

**Benefits of Registry Pattern:**
- No switch statements ever
- O(1) map lookup performance
- Zero code changes for new methods
- Follows Open-Closed Principle

## Detailed Comparison

| Problems with Old (Factory Method) | Benefits of New (Registry Pattern) |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Switch statements grow infinitely | No switch statements ever |
| Must modify factory for new methods | Zero code changes for new methods |
| O(n) performance with many cases | O(1) map lookup performance |
| Violates Open-Closed Principle | Follows Open-Closed Principle |
| Teams blocked on central changes | Teams work independently |
| All methods compiled together | Can add methods at runtime |
| Hard to test (mock entire factory) | Easy to test (mock individual creators) |
| Tight coupling to implementations | Loose coupling via function types |

## Adding New Payment Method

### ❌ Old Way (Painful)

1. Create BNPLPayment struct
2. **MODIFY PaymentFactory switch:**
   ```go
   case "BNPL":
     return &BNPLPayment{}
   ```
3. **RISK** breaking existing methods
4. **FULL** recompilation needed
5. **BLOCKS** other teams' work

### ✅ New Way (Easy)

1. Create BNPLPayment struct
2. Create CreateBNPLPayment() function
3. **REGISTER:**
   ```go
   registry.Register("BNPL", CreateBNPL)
   ```
4. **DONE!** Zero existing code changes
5. **Can even register at runtime!**

## Real-World Usage

### ❌ Nobody Uses Factory Method at Scale

- Switch statements with 50+ cases
- Becomes unmaintainable nightmare
- Big tech companies avoid this
- Considered anti-pattern
- Taught in tutorials, not used in production

### ✅ Everyone Uses Registry Pattern

- **Netflix**: Video encoder registry
- **Uber**: Matching algorithm registry
- **Stripe**: Payment method registry
- **AWS**: Service registry (200+ services)
- **Kubernetes**: Controller registry

## Interview Impact

### ❌ Using Factory Method Switch Shows

- Tutorial-level thinking
- Doesn't understand scalability
- Follows outdated patterns
- Would create maintenance nightmares

### ✅ Using Registry Pattern Shows

- Production-level thinking
- Understands real-world constraints
- Knows modern patterns used by big tech
- Would create scalable, maintainable systems
